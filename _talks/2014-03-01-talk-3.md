* Project Description: The NH3 Stratified Injection Strategy optimizes ammonia spray combustion in engines, aiming to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions. Currently applied in marine engines, this emerging technology lacks comprehensive research for land engines. Our project involves the numerical simulation of ammonia/diesel terrestrial
engines employing various injection timings, delves into the combustion characteristics, in-cylinder dynamic processes, and emission features of the engine, and provides a comprehensive exploration and analysis. This endeavor furnishes a theoretical foundation and data support for the dissemination and optimization of this technology in terrestrial engines.
* Responsibilities: Independently proposed the research topic and authored a comprehensive research paper; Contributed to engine experimental platform setup; Designed a novel ammonia/diesel coaxial injection nozzle using SOLIDWORKS; Created engine models and ammonia-diesel reaction mechanisms with UG and CONVERGE; Analyzed NH3 layered injection effects and determined optimal injection timings using CONVERGE and Tecplot.
