Hi there! My name is Huang Chu and you can call me Aurora. I’m currently pursuing my undergraduate degree in Energy and Power Engineering at Hunan University. Now, I would like to briefly introduce myself from three aspects.

  - Academics

Over the past three years, my academic performance has steadily improved and I have consistently ranked first in major courses such as Engineering Fluid Mechanics, Materials Mechanics, and Combustion. Because of my excellent academic performance, I was awarded the Academic Scholarship in 2021, the School Second Class Scholarship in 2022, and the School Outstanding Student Award and School First Class Scholarship in 2023. Meanwhile, being the class monitor, I won the Excellent Student Cadre Award in 2023. During my internship at Yuchai Machinery Group Co. LTD, I won the Outstanding Intern Award owing to my work ethic.

Speaking of scientific research, I think my open-mindedness and proactive attitude are my greatest strengths. Since my freshman year, I have actively engaged with professors across a diversity of research domains, establishing connections and participating in academic projects. At the end of my sophomore year, I successfully applied for a national-level science and technology innovation project titled “Preparation and Optimization Design of High-Performance Aerogels”. The project aims to discover the aerogel with optimal thermal insulation properties by adding different amounts of opacifying agents and determine its insulating performance through testing. This project is currently in progress and is expected to be completed next April. In my junior year, I independently proposed a research topic and embarked on an in-depth investigation under the guidance of Professor Yinjie Ma. In this study, we proposed a novel ester coolant for battery immersion cooling systems by experiment and compared its insulating performance with other coolants by simulation. Eventually, I submitted a paper as the first author to the Energy Journal, and it was successfully published in December.

As for extracurricular activities, I prefer fishing. Even if I get nothing, I still regard it as a nice mental reset and a great social tool. Through fishing, I have met many excellent senior citizens and learned knowledge from various fields. Besides, I like watching football matches because I think football has its unique ability to unite people from different cultures, backgrounds, and languages under a common passion. This aligns with my motivation for pursuing my Doctor's degree abroad.
